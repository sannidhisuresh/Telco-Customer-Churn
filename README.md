**Telco-Customer-Churn**

This project analyzes customer churn for a telecom company and predicts which customers are likely to leave (churn). The goal is to identify key factors influencing churn and build a machine learning model for prediction.

**Overview**

This project performs a complete end-to-end analysis, including:

* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Building a machine learning churn prediction model
* Model evaluation & insights

**Dataset**

The dataset includes:

* Customer demographics
* Subscribed services
* Contract type
* Tenure
* Monthly & total charges
* Churn status

**Dataset file:** [Churn_Predicted.csv](https://github.com/sannidhisuresh/Telco-Customer-Churn/blob/main/Churn_Predicted.csv)

**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

* Handled missing values
* Converted categorical columns to numeric
* Scaled numerical values
* Checked correlations

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Churn distribution
* Contract type effect
* Tenure vs churn
* Monthly charges analysis

**Machine Learning Model**

The churn prediction model uses:

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier
* Train–Test Split
* Classification Report
* Confusion Matrix

The model predicts whether a customer will churn or stay.

**Tools & Technologies**

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook
