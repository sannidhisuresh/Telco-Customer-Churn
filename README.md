## Telco-Customer-Churn

This project analyzes customer churn for a telecom company and predicts which customers are likely to leave (churn). The goal is to identify key factors influencing churn and build a machine learning model for prediction.

## Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecom industry. This project performs a complete end-to-end analysis, including:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualizing churn patterns

- Building a machine learning churn prediction model

- Model evaluation & insights

## Dataset

The dataset includes:

- Demographics

- Subscribed services

- Contract type

- Tenure

- Monthly & total charges

- Churn status

Dataset File: Churn_Predicted.csv

## Project Workflow
## 1 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Handled missing values

- Converted categorical columns

- Scaled numerical values

- Checked correlations

## 2️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Churn distribution

- Contract type effect

- Tenure vs churn

- Monthly charges analysis

## Visualizations
Churn Count

Churn Distribution

Contract vs Churn

Tenure vs Churn

Predicted Churn (Model Output)

## Machine Learning Model

The churn prediction model uses:

- Logistic Regression

- Random Forest Classifier

- Train–Test Split

- Classification Report

- Confusion Matrix

The model predicts whether a customer will churn or stay.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy

- Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Scikit-learn

- Jupyter Notebook

## Notebook
